    <h1>Ibn Taimiya School & College</h1>
    <p>By result, discipline, name and fame, Ibn Taimiya School & College is one of the best institutions all over the country. Friendly learning environment is the quality of it. The teaching stuff and management of Ibn Taimiya School & College is efficient, excellent and favourite to the students. Our college was established in 1996 but the result of it is very excellent. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th & 14th Stands in Comilla Education Board and acquiring 4th, 6th, 7th position of top ten in HSC, SSC,JSC exam. The objective of Ibn Taimiya School & College is to ensure quality education and supply quality manpower for the development of the nation. It is very painful, sorrowful and alarming that the standard of education in our country is very low and questionable. Student politics, campus violence and social unconsciousness are liable and responsible for it. We want to turn out form it and try to give environment for quality education. Al-hamdulillah, in this time we are successful, and hopeful. We want to get help from stockholders and society to fulfill our commitment and target, aim and objectives. Pray for us. Thank you.</p>
